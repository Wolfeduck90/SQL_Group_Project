# E-Commerce Database Design

## 🎯 Objective
This project is designed to help you master database design by creating an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and building a functional e-commerce database.

---

## 🛠️ Features
- **Structured Tables**: Tables for managing brands, products, categories, sizes, variations, and attributes.
- **Relationships**: Foreign keys and constraints to ensure data integrity.
- **Data Flow**: Optimized flow between entities to support e-commerce operations.

---

## 🗃️ Tables Created
### Product Information
1. `product` - Stores general product details (e.g., name, base price, brand).
2. `product_category` - Classifies products into categories (e.g., clothing, electronics).
3. `product_item` - Represents purchasable items with specific variations.
4. `product_image` - Stores image URLs or file references.

### Variations & Attributes
1. `product_variation` - Links products to size and color variations.
2. `color` - Manages available color options.
3. `size_category` - Groups sizes into categories (e.g., clothing, shoe sizes).
4. `size_option` - Lists specific sizes (e.g., S, M, L, 42).
5. `product_attribute` - Stores custom attributes (e.g., material, weight).
6. `attribute_category` - Groups attributes into categories (e.g., physical, technical).
7. `attribute_type` - Defines attribute types (e.g., text, number, boolean).
